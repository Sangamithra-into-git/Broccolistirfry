Trim the flower off the broccoli, and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces.
Peel the broccoli stalks with a vegetable peeler to remove the tough outer skin, and slice 1/4 inch thick on the diagonal. 
Set aside.
Whisk together 1/2 cup water, soy sauce, cornstarch and sugar in a small bowl. Set aside.
Heat a large wok over high heat.
Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil, and swirl to coat the pan. 
Once the oil begins to smoke, add the broccoli flowers and stems. 
Cook, stirring constantly, until browned around the edges, about 2 minutes. 
Add 2 tablespoons of water to steam the broccoli, and cook, stirring constantly, until tender, about 2 minutes more. 
Push the broccoli to the edges of the pan, forming an empty well in the center. 
Add the remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, then the scallions, garlic, ginger and pepper flakes, and stir until aromatic, 30 to 45 seconds. 
Add the soy mixture, and stir until the sauce has thickened and the broccoli is coated, about 30 seconds.
Remove from the heat, add the sesame oil and stir to coat.
